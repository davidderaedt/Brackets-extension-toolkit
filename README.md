#Brackets Extension toolkit

This extension was created to make building Brackets extensions easier.

The toolkit:

*	Contains a customizable extension template you can just drag and drop to create new extensions very quickly.
*	Adds useful shortcuts to the `Help` menu to directly open the Brackets `src` folder, and to open the Brackets wiki in a new browser window.
*	Uses its own source code to help new developers understand how to build extensions.

##Install from URL

1. Open the the Extension Manager from the File menu
2. Copy paste the URL of the github repo or zip file


##Instructions

Install as any Bracket extension (see below), and check the `Help` menu.

To use the template, simply browse for this extension "template" folder and copy it under the user folder.
Alternatively, you can copy it in the `extensions/disabled` folder.

To learn how to build extensions, choose `Open Extension Tutorial src` under the `Help` menu: it will open its own source code.
